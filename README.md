To get started, follow these steps: <br />

In the project directory, run `npm install`. This will install the dependencies for your express server.

Run `cd client && npm install` to install the dependencies for the frontend of the app.

Use the `.sql` files to setup your __PostgreSQL__ database.

You should now be able to run the app in __development mode__ via `npm run server` and `npm run client`. You may also install concurrently as a __devDependency.__
